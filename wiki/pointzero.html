    <h1>Point Zero</h1>
    <p>Point Zero is a first-person walking simulator which consists of several chapters.</p>
    
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>The player is introduced as a construction worker in the massive underground complex labeled 'Point Zero.' The player initially recieves several useful tools such as a screwdriver and a flashlight which come in handy throughout the game. The game is completed once the player reaches the surface outside of Point Zero.</p>
    
    <h3>Plot</h3>
    <p>The game consists of multiple chapters, each representing a major point in the plot. The irregular plot begins when the player falls of a railing into 'The Pit' (a huge ravine the center of the complex) and surpisingly survives. He slowly starts discovering the hidden corruption that has been keeping the citizens of Point Zero down below the ground and begins to believe a myth of a utopian society on the surface. Once the player reachers their initial starting point, he is mentally suaded to take a previously found maintinence shaft to the surface, in which he counters many puzzles and conflicts along the way. The game ends once the city officials lock the player on the surface (which turns out to be complete wasteland from the previous Oak Falls disaster) until death to keep information about the surface from spreading.</p>
