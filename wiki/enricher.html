    <h1>Enricher</h1>
    <p>Enricher is an idle game that represents no specific instance of Dirsteadean history. Instead, it represents a hyperbolic simulation of real-life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a> and its threat to society.</p>
    <p>It also consists of a primarily "hilarious" mood through its hyperbolic technologies and upgrades which symbolically represent the progression of technological development throughout Dirsteadean history.</p>
    
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>The player begins in a warehouse of sorts and is given the opportunity to buy new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_centrifuge"uranium gas centrifuges</a> for the purpose of secret <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium">uranium enrichment</a>. The player can reach the end of the game in any permitted fasion. The game is considered 'over' once the player has activated every Void upgrade and produces 100% enriched uranium. Even though the game is over, it can still played up to infinite percentage.</p>
    
    <h3>Upgrades</h3>
    <p>All of the game's upgrades can be sorted into several categories: centrifuge strength, power generation, space, noise emmissions, scientists, and public demand.</p>
    <p>Centrifuge strength dictates how fast the rotor motors can turn, which would in turn increase enrichment level per centrifuge. There are 20 different levels, starting with PVC and ending with The Void, which yeilds infinite structural stability and therefore can handle infinite speed.</p>
    <p>Power generation dictates how many centrifuges can be activated at once as well as the speed per motor. There are several levels, beginning with diesel generators and ending with Void Power, which, for comparison purposes, yields 2000000x the power of the on-site reactor.</p>
    <p>Space dictates how many centrifuges can be used at once, similar to power generation. This upgrade type, however, does not care how fast the rotors are spinning. The levels include basement, warehouse, dimensional simulation, and dimensional Void.</p>
    <p>Noise emmissions are an important factor since they dictate how likely you are to be caught by the authorities. Nuclear proliferation is a serious crime in the game's setting, so getting caught causes an immediate loss of the game. The levels include silent motors, foam absorption, loud neighbors, and Void traps.</p>
    <p>Scientists are also an important upgrade type, since they dictate what other upgrades are possible to activate. Scientists need to discover a particular upgrade before it can be activated. Better scientists can discover more powerful upgrades. The player begins with grad students and ends with subquantum Void brain, which can discover all of the Void upgrades.</p>
    <p>Demand dictates how many customers the player is likely to obtain. It can also affect the probability of getting caught, but does not have as much of an impact as noise emmissions. The levels include nuclear campaigns, nuclear samples, hive mind, and Praise the Void.</p>
